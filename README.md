# Network-Intrusion-Detection
  In the face of evolving cyber threats, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) must continuously advance to maintain robust security. This study presents an innovative NIDS framework that leverages intensive data preprocessing techniques and a hybrid approach combining deep learning and traditional machine learning models. Utilizing the UNSW-NB15 dataset, we implemented comprehensive preprocessing steps, including oversampling, outlier detection, and correlation analysis, to enhance data quality and representation. Our approach integrates a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to capture temporal dependencies in network traffic data, benchmarked against Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers.

  The results demonstrate that intensive preprocessing significantly enhances model performance, with the LSTM model outperforming traditional classifiers in detecting various network intrusions. This hybrid methodology underscores the importance of robust preprocessing and the application of deep learning models in developing effective NIDS. The study's findings contribute to the ongoing advancement of cybersecurity measures, providing a foundation for future research aimed at fortifying network defenses against sophisticated attacks. Future work will explore additional deep learning architectures and real-time detection capabilities to further improve system efficacy.
